## Open Questions
- Which network to use? 
- Which chain to use? 
- Is a node necesary? 
- Will flashswaps be too expensive with gas? 
- What existing contracts can we leverage? 
- Best way to interact with a CEX? Is that needed for arb?
- For load attacks, does origin of request matter? Need different IPs or geos? Use different contacts? 
  -Does the blockchain care? Do the providers aka UniSwap care, monitor, protect?
